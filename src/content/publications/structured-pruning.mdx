title: "A Generalization of Continuous Relaxation in Structured Pruning"
abstract: "Structured pruning asserts that while large networks enable us to find solutions to complex computer vision problems, a smaller, computationally efficient sub-network can be extracted. We propose a generalization of continuous relaxation in structured pruning to effectively identify these optimal sub-networks, ensuring performance on resource-constrained hardware."

Structured pruning enables the extraction of computationally efficient sub-networks from large neural architectures. This paper introduces a generalized continuous relaxation method to improve this process.
