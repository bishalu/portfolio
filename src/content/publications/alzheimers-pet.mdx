title: "A Comparison of FDG and Amyloid PET for the Deep Learning Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease"
abstract: "This research compares the efficacy of FDG PET (metabolic) and Amyloid PET (pathological) biomarkers in training Deep Learning models for Alzheimer's prediction. The study focuses on applying these models to data from underprivileged communities, evaluating accessibility versus predictive power for early diagnosis."
