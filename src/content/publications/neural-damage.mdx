title: "Circumventing neural damage in a C. elegans chemosensory circuit using genetically engineered synapses"
abstract: "Investigating neural circuit plasticity, this study demonstrates how genetically engineered electrical synapses can reroute information flow to circumvent damaged neurons. By expressing connexin gap junctions, we successfully restored chemotaxis behavior in C. elegans after critical interneuron loss, highlighting the potential of artificial synapses in neural repair."
