title: "INX-18 and INX-19 play distinct roles in electrical synapses that modulate aversive behavior"
abstract: "Electrical synapses are critical for fast neural communication. This paper elucidates the distinct functional roles of innexin proteins INX-18 and INX-19 in forming gap junctions that modulate aversive behavioral responses in Caenorhabditis elegans, contributing to our understanding of the genetic basis of behavior."
