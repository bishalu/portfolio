## The Problem

You built a perfect 2-hour set. The gig just got extended to 5 hours. Adding random tracks kills the vibe. You need more of *your* set, not someone else's.

## The Magic

We analyze your setlist's **energy signature**—the arc, the builds, the drops. Then we generate an infinite continuation that feels like *you* curated every track. Your taste, extended.

## The Tech

- Energy curve extraction and modeling
- Transition-aware track selection
- BPM and key compatibility enforcement
