## The Problem

Off-the-shelf audio ID fails on remixes, covers, stems, or niche catalogs. You need fingerprinting that understands *your* specific audio domain.

## The Magic

We train **custom neural networks** on your audio corpus. Your model learns *your* music—the quirks, the production styles, the metadata you care about. Identification that no generic API can match.

## The Tech

- MuQ encoder architecture (custom developed)
- Contrastive learning on spectral features
- Trained on your data, deployed in your pipeline
