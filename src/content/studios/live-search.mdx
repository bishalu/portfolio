## The Problem

Static databases get stale. Playlists feel recycled. You want the track that dropped *yesterday*, not the algorithm's safe picks from 2019.

## The Magic

We don't store a catalog—we **search the entire web** in real-time. Ask for "cyberpunk jazz that sounds like blade runner but Indonesian," and we'll find it. If it exists anywhere on the internet, we'll surface it.

## The Tech

- **Perplexity Sonar Pro** for live web retrieval
- Custom prompt engineering for musical context
- Sub-2 second response times even for esoteric requests
