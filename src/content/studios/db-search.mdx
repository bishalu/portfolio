## The Problem

Traditional search: type "happy summer song," get results with those exact words in the title. Useless. You want tracks that *feel* like happy summer, even if they're in Japanese.

## The Magic

We embedded millions of tracks into a semantic vector space. Search by **vibe**, not vocabulary. "Something that sounds like driving through LA at sunset" actually works here.

## The Tech

- Custom audio embeddings from spectral analysis
- Hybrid retrieval: semantic + metadata filtering
- Sub-100ms query response at scale
