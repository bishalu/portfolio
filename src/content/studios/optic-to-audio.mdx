## The Problem

You're staring at a venue. Rooftop bar, fairy lights, 8pm golden hour. You *know* what should play, but you can't articulate it. Words fail where vibes don't.

## The Magic

Snap a photo. We extract the **visual mood**—lighting, setting, energy level, aesthetic cues—and translate that directly into musical characteristics. No words needed.

## The Tech

- Vision models extract scene attributes
- Cross-modal mapping to audio features
- Context chain: image → vibe → archetype → tracks
