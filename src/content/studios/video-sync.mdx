## The Problem

Stock music is generic. Licensing is expensive. You need a 47-second track that hits a swell at 0:23 when the logo appears. Good luck finding that.

## The Magic

Upload your video. We analyze the **rhythm of your edits**—cuts, transitions, key moments—and generate original music that syncs perfectly. Every beat lands where you need it.

## The Tech

- Frame-by-frame edit detection
- Tempo matching to cut rhythm
- Dynamic intensity mapping
