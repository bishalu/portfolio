## The Problem

Shuffle is chaos. Pre-made playlists ignore *your* crowd. Professional DJs spend years developing intuition for track ordering. That intuition is a reasoning process—and it can be learned.

## The Magic

We built a **custom reasoning model** trained on the art of set construction. It understands harmonic mixing, energy arcs, crowd psychology, and the subtle magic of "this track just *feels* right after that one."

## The Tech

- Fine-tuned LLM on DJ set theory
- Camelot wheel + energy state encoding
- Multi-objective optimization (key, BPM, vibe, narrative)
