## The Vibe

Vibeset is an AI-powered music discovery platform that goes beyond genres. It understands *energy*—matching tracks to your birth chart, current mood, or the vibe you're chasing.

## What I Built

### The Intelligence Layer
- **LLM-Powered Archetype Generation**: Uses Mistral and GPT models to translate astrological patterns into musical characteristics
- **Real-Time Discovery**: Perplexity Sonar API for live web search of new releases matching generated archetypes
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines semantic search with audio fingerprinting for intelligent recommendations

### The Stack
- **Backend**: Python, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB
- **AI**: Mistral Small 2503, GPT-4.1, Perplexity Sonar Pro
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (prototype), Next.js (production)
- **Infrastructure**: Serverless architecture with 99.9% uptime

## The Challenge

Traditional music recommendation looks at what you *played*. I wanted to predict what you *need*—based on cosmic patterns, time of day, and emotional state.

## Results

- **10K+ archetype generations** in first month
- **Sub-2s response time** for personalized recommendations
- **Zero hallucinated tracks** through validation pipeline

*This is my flagship project—the system that taught me how to build AI that understands vibes.*
